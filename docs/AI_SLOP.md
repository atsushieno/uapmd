# UAPMD AI Slop State of Union

UAPMD contains a lot of AI-generated and even AI-designed sources that are not suitable for human consumption for health. They indicate that the API is either not polished enough, or implementation is often awkward and not simplified enough.

Unless otherwise noted, "I" points to @atsushieno.

## remidy

- GUI API: it is almost AI generated implementation. I defined the API similar to CLAP GUI extension and let AI coders adopt to each format. That's a lot of annoyances to adjust to each format's nature.
- Audio Buses and channel layouts API: after I give initial design for channel layouts, bus definition (that app developers cannot change), and buses configuration (that app developers can change), they are almost automatically generated. Those AI coders often changed the API to have it match their expectation.
- Per-note controller API: there is a lot of overlaps with parameter API and implementation, so I let AI generate a lot of "likewise" implementation.
- Parameter updates API: transmits of parameter value changes were mostly by those AI coders, including some parts of the API. I prohibited a lot of arbitrary API bloats, but not that was not absolute.

## remidy-gui

- Nowadays it is almost all AI slop; the GUI stuff is mostly done by AI coders, and this module is no exception.
- It only features `ContainerWindow` for each platform, and `GLContextGuard` that is used to restore GL context after UI events are handled on the UI thread loop.

## uapmd

- At some stage it involved a lot of AI slop, but there was a lot of API and implementation reorganization and cleanup that ended up splitting `uapmd` from `uapmd-engine`, and this module became solid human-designed API with some AI implementation. The `UapmdFunctionBlock` API and around should make sense.
- `AudioPluginGraph` and `AudioPluginNode` are primarily used by the sequencer engine that could involve a lot of changes, but essentially it is designed to be abstract and only minimum use cases are covered.

## uapmd-data

- Its `timeline` part started as a part of `uapmd-app` module and was mostly **designed and** written by AI coders.
- `project` API structure is human-designed, but the JSON serializer is totally designed and generated by AI coders, including the documentation.
- SMF/SMF2 converter is implemented by AI coders, while at some stage I instructed them to use `umppi::*` API. The quality of their work is poor there in general.

## uapmd-engine

- It started as `SequencerEngine` extraction from `uapmd`, and was like a God class, but now it's quite smaller with less AI-generated code.
- the entire module is essentially not part of our API that we care about yet; we are not designing a sequencer engine library. It is part of `uapmd-app` as our PoC MIDI 2.0 sequencer, to isolate business logic from the GUI (reusable from scripting engine as well as other GUI frameworks).

## uapmd-app

- Most of the GUI components were generated by AI, by either porting from old Web-based app UI or migration to ImGui.
- It also applies to `AppModel`; it was edited quite a lot for the features introduced to the UI. While its API is exposed to `UapmdJSRuntime` as our JavaScript API, things are not designed to be stable at all.
- The JavaScript API is often "regenerated" by the AI coders ("update the API to match the latest C++ API" kind of) before we push new releases (but not every time).
